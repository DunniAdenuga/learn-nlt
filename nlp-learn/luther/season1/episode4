My love For the ones that feel it the most Look at her with her eyes like a flame She will love you like a fly Will never love you again.
PHONE RINGS What? Ian.
Three victims in five weeks, spread across London.
Vics two and three have been picked up on camera, heading home alone after nights out.
We don't know about Monica yet.
The first victim died a month ago.
The second, two weeks later.
The third, a week after that.
And now Monica five days later.
Oh, he's escalating fast.
This ain't just a serial this man's on a murder spree.
Three previous victims were found in Isleworth, Whitton, West Drayfield.
All of them were walking home alone.
Now the dump sites are far apart, but broadly similar, near trading estates.
So the Met think our man may have been a delivery driver of some sort.
Hence White Van Man.
The Met passed on data from two thousand hours of CCTV footage, Tracked down and eliminated all vans and other commercial vehicles within a two-kilometre bulls-eye zone.
Those who couldn't be eliminated were added to the suspect pool.
Tactical Unit 1, under my command, will focus on last night's murder.
Tactical Unit 2 will be based here under the command of DCI Luther.
You'll review all existing case evidence pertaining to the previous victims.
Focus on the suspect pool, eliminate those unidentified vehicles.
Our man is locked into a pattern of rapid escalation.
He's going to kill again, very soon, except we are going to catch him before he gets the chance.
You all right in here? History of a case like this says he's in our database somewhere.
We just have to prise him out.
I'm sorry to bother you, Ma'am.
I thought it best.
Is he fit enough to be questioned? Officially, it's too early to say.
Unofficially? He's looking very good.
Police arrested two kids yesterday.
One was drinking battery acid, the other was eating fireworks.
They charged one and let the other one off.
Tommy Cooper.
Boom, boom.
It was Basil Brush that said, boom, boom.
Oops.
Henry Madsen woke up.
Are you in trouble? Possibly.
Might be.
Might be in trouble.
I do know that I will be put under surveillance.
My movements, my phone calls everything.
Why? I think they're worried that I might sneak in and finish the job.
Well, you might be mad, but you're not stupid.
Yeah.
I can't see you any more.
I can't talk to you.
Sorry.
You know, I really am.
But I can't do this any more, not while this thing is hanging over my head.
It's over.
No.
Yes, Alice, it's over.
I've got to go.
Got work to do.
No! Yes.
No! Morning, love.
Morning.
Not yet! Dirty hands.
Oh? Grease.
You all right? Yeah, yeah, just washing me hands.
Textbook, after the first kill he goes into the depressive phase.
He can't believe what he's done.
Until the urge becomes uncontrollable.
The cooling off periods get shorter and shorter, but not this quickly, so what's driving the escalation? Do you have any sexual fantasies? What? Yeah, none that I'm going to tell you about.
Does the reality ever live up to the fantasy? I erm Well, no.
No, not really.
It can't can it? That doesn't account for the pace of escalation.
No, no.
But we're not looking at a release, here.
we're looking at an explosion.
You know.
What makes a man just let go? The trigger event is usually some kind of perceived humiliation.
You know, loss of a job, or a spouse.
PHONE RINGS I've got to take this.
Zo? I just called You OK? I'm great.
Well, I've never had an affair before.
So, I don't know what to do.
'Is it still called an affair 'if I'm sleeping with my wife behind her lover's back?' Look, I've got to go.
Hello there.
Coffee's on.
You're up early.
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.
'It's been announced that earlier today the body of a young woman 'was found on a playing field near Wandsworth Common.
' Gray? You home, love? Yeah.
In here.
Happy birthday.
Gray.
I thought you'd forgotten.
Of course I haven't, no.
No, no, never.
Come on, sit sit down, relax.
Open your present.
Ohgosh.
Oh, goodness gracious.
That's It's really lovely.
Put it on.
Can you help me with this? There you go.
How does it look? Stand up.
Let me see.
Come on, stand up, stand up.
It looks lovely.
It looks really lovely.
It's really gorgeous.
SHE GAGS No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, not here.
Graham, not here.
Upstairs, upstairs.
Go on.
DISTANT OUT OF TUNE SINGING Something's going to happen tonight, obviously.
What a terrible band.
Hiya.
Hi.
Hello, Gray! How you doing! Good to see you mate.
Have a seat, have a seat.
Yeah all right.
Linda, how you doing? Happy birthday! What you going to have to drink guys? White wine please, a big one.
Er, yeah, coke please, mate.
Same again everyone, yeah? There you go, madam.
Thank you.
Enjoy.
So did you you get anything nice for your b-day? Erm, yeah I got this, he got me a necklace.
I thought he'd forgotten.
When did he give it to you? Just, er, well just before I come out, which is why I thought he'd forgotten.
I didn't get anything this morning.
What's all this? Decoupage.
The cut-up technique.
Take a bit of text, cut it up randomise it, make new text.
See new patterns.
Where'd you learn this? David Bowie.
It's how he wrote his lyrics.
You a fan? Don't I look like a fan? What of songs about like aliens and that? No there's a bit more to him than aliens.
I'll make you a tape.
A what, sorry? Ah.
You've gone all David Bowie on us.
Yeah, cause of death confirmed.
He chokes them.
No forensics to speak of, no witnesses.
I spent the day interviewing the family.
There's mother, one sister, one boyfriend, long term.
Is he on the list? No he was pulling a night-shift.
I took him through the inventory, the stuff our man left around her.
Anything missing? Yeah, necklace.
Some of these guys keep news clippings, photographs.
The fact that it's jewellery? Suggests that he's married, in a relationship.
He'd give the necklace to his wife, girlfriend.
Every time he sees it, he's taken back to the kill.
But the suddenness of it? What sets him off like that? She's about to leave him.
So it just pushes him over the edge.
We don't need insight into his tortured soul to understand who he is.
We just need to know, who the hell he is and where the hell he's at.
Oh, no, really, really I'm really shocked, is that meant to be me, charming.
It's got your eyes, it's lovely.
Sorry, love.
Listen, I've got to go to work! That's all right, don't worry.
Happy birthday! You enjoy yourself! Look after her for me, mate, won't ya? Make sure she has a good time! Will do mate, yeah.
Sorry we were running a bit late tonight, mate.
But, er, I had to give her one for her birthday.
You know how she likes it, good and hard and long.
Tell you the truth, I'm surprised she can walk.
See you later.
Yeah, see you later.
So why was she walking home by herself? She was meeting friends in the pub to talk about the hen night.
She's happy, she's engaged, she's on home turf.
She's not about to get into a white van with Jack the Lad.
Blitz attack.
He jumps out, drags her into the van.
There was no screams, no sign of any altercation.
She trusted him.
He knows her, maybe? He can't have known all four of them.
No he didn't.
But they trusted him.
They trusted him.
I think we're looking for a taxi driver.
Luther.
Luther.
Luther! What's wrong? Henry Madsen is talking.
The doctors won't let us anywhere near him, not yet.
So right now, anything says means nothing.
It's inadmissible.
Hearsay.
Guv, what's he saying? Your name.
Right, OK.
OK.
Ten minutes ago we got this.
This is the south end of Broughton Row.
It's the closest to our hit.
Is that her? Yeah we think it's her.
Tell me we got the number plate.
Number plate.
Driver's name, home address, phone number.
Just triangulating the mobile phone signal now.
We've got him locked on.
Good.
So Go, go! Hey, love! I don't need a cab, thanks.
I don't live that far.
It's not that.
It's just come over the radio, some girl's been attacked just down the road, just past Holywell Avenue.
Oh, you're joking.
He got away before he could do too much, but they've warned us to keep an eye out.
I had to stop and tell you love, they make us do it.
Yeah.
You sure you'll be all right? Yeah.
It's not far.
Where do you live? Erm, Lacey Road? Just down that way? That's past Holywell, innit? Listen, I'd hate it if my girl had to walk home alone, this time of night, with all this going on.
Hop in.
I can't.
I haven't got any Forget the money.
We'll just get you home safely.
Come Christmas, give five quid to the dog's home for me.
Are you sure? Get in.
Come on.
Got you.
SIRENS BLARE Police, step out the vehicle.
Trevor Rowan, I'm arresting you on suspicion of murder.
You do not have to say anything or to mention when questioned something you later rely on in court.
I haven't done anything! It's all right, love.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, I think you missed a turn back there, that was my street, Lacey Road? Excuse me.
Excuse me! What's wrong? Just that you said he was impotent.
He is.
Well, he was.
I don't know, It's come back.
The last few weeks, it's come back.
I hate it.
Do we have to talk about this? When I'm here, can't I just be here? He knows, don't he? About me and you? He absolutely knows.
SHE SOBS Hey, babe, please.
No.
Oh You all right? Me? Hmm.
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm great! Why? Oh, no reason, you just seemed You sure? Yeah, I'm sure.
Search your heart search your soul And when you find me there You'll search no more Don't tell me Stop.
What? Stop.
.
.
it's not worth fighting for I hate that song.
You love it, you love it.
I hate it.
You love it.
Help! 'Hello, you are through to Zoe Luther.
'Please leave me a message after the tone and I'll get back' His alibi sticks.
He was on Eccleston Road, SW1.
He's not our man.
So there are two taxis with the same number-plate on the same night in London? Yeah, no he just cloned them.
It's easy to do, you know.
So what do we have? Well, we have this He attempts to make a turn, at the end of Broughton Row, messes up, does a U-turn.
So we checked it out and it turns out that Broughton Row used to be a through-way.
But when the hookers moved in, they locked it off and made it a rat-run.
This was when? March, er, 2002.
The implication being? Well, I don't think he's a real taxi driver.
He tried to be one, or used to be one but KNOCK AT DOOR Yeah.
Not only is there no law against selling second-hand taxis, it's easy and cheap.
How many people are out in these things? There's no database.
But it runs into the early thousands.
God.
It's more than you want to think about, let alone track down.
He could have a different plate for every night of the month.
He's completely anonymous.
One taxi and 20,000 others.
Trusted by default.
He might as well be invisible.
Yeah, and he's on a feeding frenzy.
There'll be another body tomorrow.
And another and another.
PHONE RINGS Teller.
Chartwell Hospital's on fire.
ALARM BEEPS Excuse me, sorry.
Sorry, excuse me, thank you.
Er, Officer? Fulford.
We're having some trouble with a few members of the public on ward 28.
SHOUTING They're refusing to leave the building.
Response is on its way but since you're here I'm not supposed to I wouldn't ask if I didn't think it was an emergency.
I'll wait with the patient.
Ward 28? Next floor down.
MACHINES BEEP (Don't say his name.
) Cabbies who've been sacked, invalided off, retired, plus a list of drivers who've tried and failed the Knowledge over the last 20 years, triangulated, cross-referenced with the suspect pool.
Best? Left with 23 names.
Sergeant Ripley, would you mind if I borrowed Detective Chief Inspector for a moment? Umno.
No, Sir.
Stressful day.
Oh, five victims dead, possibly another in 12 hours.
Henry Madsen passed away.
I'm sorry? It could be fluke, unconnected with the fire.
But, the fire was arson and these two events, co-occurring.
Madsen had a permanent guard.
Who was directed away from his post by some doctor.
What doctor? HE SCOFFS Well, quite.
Young, very pretty, dark-haired and heterochromatic.
Heterowhat? I'm sorry? Different coloured eyes.
Like David Bowie.
But no doctor with heterochromia of the eye is currently employed by the Chartwell hospital.
Well, I don't know, some doctor lost a contact lens, perhaps? Probably? But if not If somebody is impersonating, posing as a doctor, someone who wants access to Henry Madsen.
would you have any notion of who that might be? I could think off 100 people that would want to see him dead.
But I'd start off with the parents of the victims.
Yes, of course.
HE SIGHS But the timing you see, the timing, it, it chafes my brain.
Why now? Why todaythe day after he wakes up? I don't know, Martin.
We'll just have to put that down to a bigmystery.
Well, I can see you're busy.
PHONE RINGS Hello? Don't worry about the call being traced.
This is a disposable phone.
One conversation, I wipe it and it goes into someone else's garbage.
Listen to me, I think I told you that I don't want to speak to you.
Not today, not tomorrow.
Not EVER again.
Well, there's a remarkable absence of gratitude for you.
Do you know, what you've done? Given you back your wife.
Saved your job.
Saved you from disgrace and imprisonment.
No, you've committed murder.
All I did was finish the job you started.
What are you going to do, arrest me? Yes! I have to! Shall I articulate why you won't? Stop! You made me do it, you threatened me.
There's phone traffic between us to prove it, including the call I'm making from this phone.
Empty threats.
You implicate me, you implicate yourself and you're too in love with your own genius for that.
Conspiracy to murder will just be the start of it I can send you to hell.
You'll burn for the rest of your life.
Which is why I would appreciate, some, gratitude! I did it for you! Pig! Filth! I did it for you! I want you to stay away! Understand, stay away from me! Stay away from my life! Stay a fucking way! Do you hear me! What can I do for you, Martin? Busy day here.
I'd like John Luther's phone and email records, please.
Go away.
I can't.
Whatever you're here to tell me, I don't want to hear it.
So do us a favour, get yourself an exorcist.
I see.
You already know.
Know what? Zoe's been LYING to you.
No, no, no.
I don't want to hear it.
All right, I want you out of my way, I want you out of my life.
Hah, yes, I've been hearing that a lot today.
I wish I could help you.
But I can't.
So I would like you please, to stay away.
You are completely Right.
KNOCK ON DOOR You all right, boss? It was the wife.
Ex wife.
Come in.
Erm, those suspects Have you eaten? What are you, my nan? Best hit, Graham Shand drinking in the same pub as victim number one.
Failed the Knowledge three times, the last time in 2002.
Until six weeks ago, he worked nights at a taxi breakdown and recovery garage.
Formerly decent employee.
Seems to have undergone some kind of breakdown - drinking, sexually inappropriate conduct.
Erm, got one.
Erm, any hard evidence? No, none.
No record of him, his wife, known friends or family ever buying a second-hand taxi.
But he's had plenty of opportunity to buy one, under the table, cash in hand, eh? Form? Er, none.
I'll get DCI Reed to the house with a warrant.
What will we do if he's not there? Get him in his weak spot.
What's that? The wife.
Always the wife.
Check her out, bring her in.
Nice work.
SHE CLEARS HER THROA So what's happening with you and Zoe? That was her on the phone just now, right? Yes, it was Zoe.
So are you and she? No.
Yes.
Possibly.
I don't know.
It's nice to see you're happy for me.
You want to know the real tragedy about marriage? No, thanks.
Women always think men will change, but they don't.
Men think women won't change but they do.
Where d'you get that from? A fortune cookie? Hmm.
I need you to stay in this building until you're cleared to leave.
I'm trying to run an investigation, here.
Yeah and like you say this is the best place to run it from.
So, just do that.
HE SIGHS No-one.
No-one's home Yeah, bye.
All right? We're shut.
Linda Shand? Yeah? Mrs Shand, I'm Detective Sergeant Ripley All right, hang on.
Who, sorry? Detective Sergeant Ripley of the Serious Crime Unit, Hobb Lane.
I wonder if you'd come with me, help clear up a few things.
What sort of thing? Probably it's nothing we just need you to answer a few questions.
About what? Graham, mostly.
Oh, my God.
Has he done Has he done something? If you'd like to come with me? Oh, I feel sick.
Can I just? Yeah, course.
Linda? What's going on? What do you mean? The police are here.
What do they want? I don't know! Well, did they mention me? What did you do?! What did they say? Have you been stealing again? No, of course I haven't! No! Then what have you done, Graham? Well, what did they say? They must have said something! What did they say?! SHE CRIES Give me the phone.
Give me the phone.
God! HE SOBS HE SOBS AND SHOUTS Not yet, not yet, not yet HE SOBS AND SHOUTS HE SOBS We don't have any other room, so I have to use the interview room.
Can I get you a drink or anything? Er yes, some water.
You want some water? Here you go.
So how are things with you and your husband? Fine.
Why? Do you know where he was Friday night? Yeah, at the pub.
With me and some friends.
It was my birthday.
Was he with you all night? Not all night, no.
Cause he, he went to work.
Work where? He works at an all night recovery garage.
The thing is Linda, Graham hasn't worked there for two months now.
You didn't know? KNOCK ON DOOR Boss? I'm sorry to interrupt it's a bit urgent.
Right now.
I'm afraid it can't wait sir, sorry.
Linda, you have to excuse me? Erm, I've got to dash.
I'll come back and we'll finish talking, all right? Sorry, talk about what, I SHE SOBS Soon as I get back, we'll talk, all right, sorry.
I time that all right? Perfect.
How is she? Well, she knows something's not right.
No.
You don't think this approach is a bit merciless? No.
SHE CRIES Graham knows we're on to him.
All right, and he'll try and kill as many as he can before we catch him.
And if I have to terrify his wife to stop that happening, I can live with that.
Thus spoke John Luther, gentleman of the parish.
SHE SOBS She knows what her husband is.
Yeah, but maybe not what he's done.
There is a difference.
SHE GASPS AND SOBS SHE SOBS No, no SHE CRIES UNCONTROLLABLY No, no, what is this? What, what is that? What is that? What what Linda? SHE CRIES No, get it off me.
What is that, what is that? Oh, my God, oh, my God, no, no No, no, my God, no, no SOBS UNCONTROLLABLY Oh, no, oh, my god, oh, my god.
What did he do? What did he do? Oh, god It's all right.
Is there a glass for me? Of course.
OK.
I have something I need, I need to say to, um to tell you.
You already know.
Yeah, pretty much.
How? Well, it hardly takes an intuitive genius, does it? Well, why didn't you say something? Perhaps it's none of my business.
Of course it's your business! Don't say that.
Please It's absolutely your business! Look, erm, look for what it's worth Oh, Mark! But seriously, this is what I think you should You should make a list of the reasons why you married him.
And then make another list of the reasons why you left him.
And then see if the two lists don't overlap.
SHE SOBS I'm so sorry.
He's not what I want.
He's just not.
Well, what do you want? This.
Here.
Right now, with you.
You all right? I can't Er, I know, I know.
It's all right, OK.
What's he done? SHE SOBS Hey, Linda, do you mind if we keep talking? Yeah? Linda, how long have you been married? Er SHE GASPS Erm20 years.
He said if I ever left him, he'd kill himself.
And, er, I tried, once.
Erm, I packed my bags and bought a ticket to Cardiff.
And he slashed his wrists in the bath and he called me before he called the ambulance.
He didn't even do it properly, he just sliced at his wrists.
There was lots of blood, lots of drama, but no real risk to Graham.
Which is the story of his life.
I'm going to ask you some really difficult and personal questions.
My intentions are not to embarrass you, OK? Is it about the handbags? Yes, yeahwhy don't you tell me about the handbags.
Early onwe must have been married a year, 18 months He used to nick them.
And, er, and I confronted him and he, he cried and he made up some story.
You reported him? No.
Why? 'Cause he's my husband.
What did you think he was doing with the hand bags? He used to, ermsniff them and, er, touch himself.
I was embarrassed.
And a bit of me thought it was A bit of me was scared it was me That I was doing something wrong and that, er, somehow, y'know, people would find out and, and they'd laugh.
Look, Linda I have to tell you Graham is involved in a very serious crime.
And these urges, these urges, that he's had, he's controlled them for a while.
Until suddenly This.
He's been murdering young women.
It's not my fault.
What, what's not your fault? What do you mean by that? Linda? Hey, hey look at me.
What's not your fault? I forgot to erase a text message.
He checks my phone, when I'm in the shower.
He goes down my handbag.
He checks your phone and, and found out you were sleeping with someone? Who is he, Linda? It's not my fault.
You need to tell me his name.
Right here it is, Dennis Keaton, 23 Black Swan Way.
Call him, tell him to keep himself safe.
Graham is punishing her for being unfaithful.
He's working his way to killing her.
